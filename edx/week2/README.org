* How to Design Data

** Exercises
*** rocket
**** PROBLEM A

 You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends 100
 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from 100 kilometers
 to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.

 Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent. Call it
 RocketDescent.

**** Solution
     #+BEGIN_SRC racket
;; RocketDescent is one of:
;;  - Integer[0, 100]
;;  - false
;; interp. Rocket kilometers to touchdown
(define RD1 100)   ; 100km to land
(define RD2 50)    ; 50km to land
(define RD3 0.5)   ; 0.5 km to land
(define RD4 false) ; landed.

#;
(define (fn-for-rocket-descent rd)
  (... rd))

;; Template rules used:
;; - one of: 2 cases
;; - atomic distinc: false
;; - atomic non-distinc: Integer (0,100]
     #+END_SRC
